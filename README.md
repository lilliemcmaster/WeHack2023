## Inspiration
Our text based action adventure game was inspired by the mystery of an enchanted forest. But, instead of being enchanted by magic, its enchanted with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. 
## What it does
The goal of this text based interactive game is to spark interest in STEM in an adventure role play that features diverse characters.
Our game is aimed for kiddos under the age of 12 to stimulate interest in STEM principles. This game exemplifies inclusion in an environment that is creative and stimulating. This game promotes understanding of introductory 
topics of physics, chemistry, computer science, and biology. 
The female lead can be one of four career types, a physicist, a computer scientist, a chemist, or a biologist. 
She follows the adventure while using her intelligence and bravery to solve challenges related to her career, with a melancholic bear sidekick!. 

## How we built it
We built the game with Renpy and created our graphics with Canva and PixilArt. 

## Challenges we ran into
Making the scope of the challenge easy enough for kids to understand. We had to really think through how to present and explain the concepts of physics in a way an 8 year old would comprehend while still engaging and having fun with our game.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Coding in Renpy for the first time! It was so fun to learn something new and have something to present in such a short time.

## What we learned
We learned how to story build, manage scope, and code a visual novel style game. 

## What's next for Orb Quest
We want Orb Quest to be more than a Visual Novel Style game. Ideally, we would have an open world adventure game with text novel features. We would want more options in animation that provides more of visual interaction with the challenges.
